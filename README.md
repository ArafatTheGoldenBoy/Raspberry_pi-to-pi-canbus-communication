#Raspberry_pi-to-pi-canbus-communication in real-time
This internship is about developing a cloud-based autonomous vehicle with a raspberry pi with a camera connected to a cloud computer and many ECUs. Cloud computers will analyze data and send it back to Pi.
Then Pi will send a can-message to every ECU. Because we do not have any ECU. So we use pi as an ECU. That pi's will be connected to actuators. Our work is to communicate pi with other pi's via CanBus.
